Alembic automatically generates migration files by comparing 
your models to the database, lets you review and adjust those 
files, and then applies them to update the database schema in 
a controlled way.



To migrate, run this cmd 
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "INSERT NAME OF MIGRATION"


# AT THE START: assuming you already have a database

# 1. Create an empty baseline migration alembic revision -m "baseline migration" 
# 2. Mark it as applied (without actually running it) alembic stamp head

alembic current:	        Show current migration version
alembic history:	        Show all migrations
alembic upgrade head:	    Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade +1:	        Apply next migration
alembic downgrade -1:	    Rollback last migration
alembic downgrade base:	    Rollback all migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message":	Create new migration by comparing models to DB
alembic revision -m "message":	                Create empty migration (manual)
